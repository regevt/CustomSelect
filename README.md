# CustomSelect
css and js implementation on html select using divs

the code searches for selects with parent div with the class 'customSelect'

the original select gets hidden behind the new "select" made of divs.

when the selected value is changed the code will set the value and selected index of the original select element and then fires an onchange event that the user can register to as usual.
